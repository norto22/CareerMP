--CareerMP 0.39 :: drag multiplayer gamemode
--
-- gameplay/drag/core.lua looks for an extension at multiplayer/gamemodes/drag/drag --
-- this file -- and every multiplayer path inside gameplay/drag/ is gated behind it
-- being present:
--
--     local function getDragGamemode()
--       -- Restore the two lines below once multiplayer drag is ready to ship.
--       -- local ext = _G[DRAG_MP_GAMEMODE_EXT]
--       ...
--       return nil
--     end
--
-- careerMP/dragSync.lua un-stubs that getter and points it here.
--
-- The important thing: this is a *network adapter*, not a race implementation. BeamNG's
-- drag code already calls these methods at exactly the right moments -- when a car
-- stages, when the tree goes green, when a timer resolves -- so the job is to turn those
-- calls into protocol messages, and to answer state queries from what the protocol has
-- delivered.
--
-- Mapping (call sites verified against the 0.39 source):
--
--   syncStageLightState      display.lua:1261,1297 -> dragRaceTreeLightUpdate    (host)
--   syncTreeLightState       display.lua:251,254   -> dragRaceTreeLightUpdate    (host)
--   notifyRaceStart          display.lua:662       -> dragRaceStart              (all)
--   updateTimerValue         times.lua:131         -> dragRaceTimerUpdateRequest (host)

--- here: onDragRaceReset sets data.isCompleted back to false (core.lua:1181) and nothing
--- can set it true again, and allRacersFinished is structurally false in MP because the
--- remote stub is created with isFinished = false (core.lua:227) and headsUpRace.onUpdate
--- skips remote racers (headsUpRace.lua:76) before any phase function could set it.
--- Keeping the flag here means core.onDragRaceReset cannot reach it.

---

--- nothing else (phaseHandlers.lua:155), the car never crosses the line, so
--- core.sendTimeslipDataToUi is never called and onDragMpTimeslipRequested never fires.
--- timeslipPending therefore stays false and tryFinalizeRace returns on its very first
--- line -- taking the DQ_GRACE shortcut below with it, which was written for exactly this
--- case but sits underneath that gate. Nothing then arms the finalise, tearDownRaceUI is
--- never reached, and the drag UI stays up for the rest of the session.
local dqAt = nil

---
--- Needed because "every car is in" is not answerable on a participant. Only the strip's

--- isFinished; on every other client the opponent is a stub that stays unfinished for
--- ever, and data.isCompleted is not set there either. The 01/08 18:27 logs show it
--- plainly -- the desktop logged "race finalised" at 253.33 and the laptop logged no such
--- line at all, so its race never ended.
---
--- So the real test is raceState.finishTimes, which IS populated on both sides -- the

--- Is a career mission running in the foreground?
---
--- A drag mission -- the BMRA events, racing an AI bot -- is a SINGLE-player race that
--- happens to take place on the same strip. Its whole flow is the singleplayer one: the
--- mission spawns the opponent, poi.lua takes its non-MP branch, and gameplay/drag runs
--- the local paths. Reporting multiplayer during one hands those races to code that is
--- expecting network racers, and separately lets our lobby claim the strip out from under
--- the mission -- which is exactly what happened: the mission set up its race at 317.7 and
--- our lobby logged "alone at strip - starting a solo run" at 367.5 on top of it.
---
--- getForegroundMissionId is the game's own test for this; phaseHandlers.lua:902 and :910
--- use it to decide whether the mission owns the result screen.

--- `isMP`, and display.lua:266's guard is commented "in MP, only allow UI updates for
--- the local racer's vehicle".
---
--- It matters. poi.lua:65 uses it to decide whether entering a lane starts a local race
--- or defers to the session; if only the host answered true, every other player driving
--- onto the strip would kick off their own private singleplayer race. And clients are

--- Moves every staging racer into the countdown phase. Idempotent.
---
--- This is the work core.lua does for a CLIENT at core.lua:956-968 and, deliberately, for
--- nobody on the host -- `if isMP and not isHost` is false for us and `elseif not isMP` is
--- false too, so onDragRaceCountdownStart advances nothing on the authority.
---
--- WHEN it happens is as important as that it happens, which is what the first attempt at
--- this got wrong. core.lua:976-984 runs an unconditional tail loop straight afterwards:
---
---   extensions.hook("startDragCountdown", racer.vehId, 0)
---   racer.phases[2].started = true
---
--- and display.startDragCountdown (display.lua:1305, the ONLY writer of
--- `racer.treeStarted = true` anywhere in gameplay/drag) discards that call at :1311 if the
--- racer is not already in phase 2. The `started = true` on the next line lands anyway, and
--- phaseHandlers.countdown will not retry because it is gated on `if not phase.started`
--- (:708). So a single frame's ordering permanently blanks the tree: updateRacerCountdown
--- returns at display.lua:893 for ever, the green light never fires startRaceFromTree,
--- phases[2].completed is never set, and no dragRaceStart is ever sent -- which strands the
--- clients too, since display.lua:915 makes them pure receivers of host-generated lights.
---
--- Hence this must run BEFORE the countdown message is applied, not a frame later.

--- Per-frame host-side repair, called from times.lua:144.

--- Two jobs. It still advances anyone left in staging, which covers the case where the
--- countdown arrives without dragLobby having advanced us first. And it restarts a tree
--- that was lost to the ordering trap above: a racer sitting in phase 2 with
--- phases[2].started set but treeStarted never assigned can only have got there by having
--- its startDragCountdown discarded, and nothing in the base game will try again.
---
--- That second half is not hypothetical. changeAllPhases refuses the 1 -> 2 transition for
--- a non-stub racer that is marginally outside its lane zone (phaseHandlers.lua:307), so
--- if the authority's car is over the line at the instant the countdown fires, only the
--- stub advances and the local racer lands in exactly that state.
