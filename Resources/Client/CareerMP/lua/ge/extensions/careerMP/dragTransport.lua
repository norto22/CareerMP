--CareerMP :: drag multiplayer transport
--
-- BeamNG 0.39 ships a complete multiplayer drag racing implementation -- the receive
-- handlers (gameplay/drag/mpDragHandlers.lua, 16 message types), the state application
-- (gameplay_drag_core.setRaceState and friends), the phase machine, the UI and the
-- timeslip. What it does not ship is the layer underneath: a session manager, a
-- transport, and the object the handlers are called with.
--
-- This file is that layer, implemented over BeamMP. It provides:
--
--   * multiplayer_sessionManager -- the 5 functions the game looks for
--   * the `bridge` object mpDragHandlers is called with (10 functions)
--   * the `state` table it keeps race bookkeeping in
--   * routing of inbound messages into gameplay_drag_mpDragHandlers.handle
--
-- Deliberately thin. The protocol lives entirely in BeamNG's code, so if a game update
-- changes it, this file should not need to.

-- The state table mpDragHandlers reads and writes. Shape is dictated by the handlers:
--   dragRaces[raceId] = { id, lobbyId, poiKey, syncCountdownStart, syncRaceStart,
--                         syncRandValue, localCountdownStart, localRaceStart, ... }
--   localClientActiveRace = the race this client is taking part in, or nil
local state = {
	dragRaces = {},
	localClientActiveRace = nil,
}

-- Authority is per strip, elected by the server, and held only while that player is
-- standing at the strip.
--
-- The first design made one player authoritative for all drag racing (lowest connected
-- id). That breaks racing outright: the authority decides when everyone is staged by
-- reading its OWN local drag state, so a player off doing deliveries has no drag data
-- and the countdown never fires for anyone. Scoping it to the strip guarantees the
-- authority is someone actually there.

--== receiving ===============================================================

--- handleDragSessionStarted does setDragRaceData(r.poiData), and if that is nil then
--- core.onDragRaceStarted gives up with "dragData is nil after setDragRaceData" and no
--- racers are ever registered -- a silent, total failure.
---
--- The definition is ~15 KB and cannot be sent (BeamMP's transport truncates it and the
--- server rejects the whole message), so the sender includes only poiKey and every
--- receiver looks the strip up on its own disk. Applied here so the remote path and the
--- host's own local-apply path both get it.

		-- crash on the second client.
		--
		-- resolveStripData returns entries of BeamNG's process-lifetime levelDragStrips
		-- cache verbatim (dragLobby.lua:139), and core.setupRacerMpStub writes every remote
		-- stub it builds into getLocalClientActiveRace().poiData.racers (core.lua:237-241).
		-- With poiData aliasing the cache, those stubs were written into the level's own
		-- strip definition and outlived the race -- so the next race's
		-- setDragRaceData(deepcopy(poiData)) installed a racers table pre-populated with
		-- stale stubs, and setDragRaceData deliberately does not clear it (core.lua:461).
		-- display.getPlayableRacer then falls back to the first isPlayable racer
		-- (display.lua:798), stubs are playable, and phaseHandlers.lua:58 does
		-- pairs(racer.wheelsCenter) on something that has never had wheels.
		--
		-- BeamNG's own path always hands it a copy (mpDragHandlers.lua:29, core.lua:1095),

		-- data is never mutated by user rules." Stubs now land in a per-race copy that dies
