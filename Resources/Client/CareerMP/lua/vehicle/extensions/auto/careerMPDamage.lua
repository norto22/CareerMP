--CareerMP :: damage between players (VEHICLE)
--
-- BeamMP sends where another player's car is, never its dents, so every game simulated
-- its own damage on its copy of that car. This extension runs in every car and does one
-- of two jobs, set by careerMP_damageSync in the game-engine Lua:
--
--   * owner: in the player's own cars (not traffic or parked), every half second while
--     the game's damage total moves, it sends the beams whose rest length or broken
--     state changed since its last message, with the moved points of those beams in the
--     car's own frame (right, forward, up from its reference node), so they fit a copy
--     that is somewhere else on another screen.
--   * copy: in another player's car, it applies such a message the way the game restores
--     a saved damaged car (beamstate.load): points moved into place, rest lengths set,
--     broken beams broken, deformation recorded.
--
-- The owner wins: a copy that disagrees with what its owner reported on more than 20
-- beams for two checks in a row (damage only this game simulated) is reset in place and
-- given the owner's full damage. An owner's reset or repair sends a cleared notice, and
-- an owner answers a request for its full damage (a copy built late, or one resynced)
-- with flagged messages the server passes only to the players who asked.
--
-- Every value from a message is checked against this car before it is used.
