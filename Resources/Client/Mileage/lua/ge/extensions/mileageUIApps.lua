--Mileage :: UI app injection (CLIENT)
--
-- Missions, challenges and scenarios each switch to their own UI app layout,
-- none of which include the multiplayer apps. Without this you lose chat and the
-- player list (and with it the ability to see who is around or leave the
-- session) the moment you start a mission. This walks the layout the game is
-- about to use and injects the MP apps into it.
--
-- On BeamNG.drive 0.39:
--   * layouts are refreshed through compat.notifyLayoutsChanged (fires the
--     UiAppLayoutsChanged guihook). The game also watches the layout files itself
--     and refreshes on change, so this is belt-and-braces.
--   * there is no rallyModeRecce mission layout, and there is a gravityRace default
--     layout.
