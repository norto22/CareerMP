--
-- Cross-machine clock mapping. Without this, multiplayer drag finish times are
-- meaningless -- not imprecise, meaningless.
--
-- gameplay/drag/phaseHandlers.lua sends a finish as `rawTime = os.clockhp()`, and the
-- host computes `elapsed = finishTime - hostStart`. os.clockhp() is process-relative:
-- the engine uses it as `t0 = os.clockhp() ... dt = os.clockhp() - t0` for measuring
-- intervals inside one process. Two machines' values are unrelated -- someone an hour
-- into their session reads ~3600 while a fresh joiner reads ~120 -- so subtracting one
-- from the other yields the difference in process uptimes, not an elapsed time.
--
-- BeamNG anticipated this: mpDragHandlers.lua calls
-- multiplayer_synclib.mapOtherClock(clientId, rawTime) and, when the extension is
-- missing, logs "using raw time" and carries on. That fallback avoids a nil error; it
-- does not produce a usable number. This file is the missing extension.
--
-- Two mechanisms, in order of preference:
--
--   1. Race anchor. The drag handlers already record, for every client, the host's
--      clock at race start (syncRaceStart) alongside our own clock at the moment we
--      received it (localRaceStart). That pairing converts between the two clocks with
--      no extra traffic. Error is one-way latency of the start broadcast.
--
--   2. Offset probe. A few round trips against the same peer, keeping the sample with
--      the lowest round-trip time, which is the one least distorted by queueing. This
--      is what removes the host's inherent accuracy advantage: without it, the host's
--      own times need no correction while everyone else's carry latency error, which on
--      a close run can decide the wrong winner.
--
-- Probing refines the anchor rather than replacing it, so a race can start before any
-- probe has completed.
