-- Load order matters:
--   1. compat        - everything else reads renamed 0.39 game APIs through it
--   2. patches       - installs the runtime wrappers that publish the enriched
--                      *MP hooks the feature extensions listen for
--   3. careerPatches - neutralises career activation's vehicle cleanup before
--                      any career can start, and keeps one failing career-start
--                      handler from skipping the rest
--   4. traffic       - hands the server's traffic amounts to the game's career
--                      traffic setup
--   5. parkingChallenge - holds other players' traffic and parked cars hidden here
--                      while a parking challenge runs (mileageEnabler reads it)
--   6. insuranceRestore - loads the game's insurance records when a join's career
--                      start leaves them empty
--   7. purchaseInsurance - gives the purchase screen a safe insurance choice when the
--                      insurance records are missing (patches wraps the game's purchase
--                      menu and looks this extension up when it is used)
--   8. features
--
-- 'manual' unload mode keeps these alive across level switches, which career
-- does constantly.

-- Order matters here. sessionManager and the gamemode both reach into the transport,
-- and the transport is what loads gameplay_drag_mpDragHandlers -- which the base game
-- never loads by itself.
